What flies forever, Rests never?
I crawl on the earth. And rise on a pillar.
What has hands but can not clap?
I run around the city, but I never move.
What an fill a room but takes up no space?
I can be caught but not thrown
What can be measured but not seen?
What has many keys but unlocks no doors?
Keeps the doctor away
What room can no one enter?
I get wet when drying. 
Santa's favorite entrance for home invasion
What has a neck but no head?
It goes around the world but stays in a corner.
It comes down but never goes up
It goes up but never comes down.
The more you take, the more you leave behind.
Full of holes, yet still holds water
What is always coming but never arrives?
What gets broken without being held?
